# Project Presentation

This repo contains some automation scripts the restful booker API available at https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html for the below API requests/sceanrios:

1. Create a booking
2. Get the booking created above
3. Update the booking (change checkout date and additional needs)


We wrote the scripts with Cypress, which can be an alternative to Postman for small project like this.
